# social-network-API

## Description
  This project involves creating the backend of a Social Network site. The project includes a NoSQL database created by using mongoose and mongodb, as well as routes that allow users to add a user, view users, view users by Id, update a user's info, and delete a user. The user can also create thoughts though the use of routes, that are tied to a particular user. Thoughts can be updated and deleted. Users can also put reactions to thoughts, which works similarly to how a user adds a comment on facebook. There are also routes that can be used to add or remove friends from a particular user.
